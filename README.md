# Easy-Number-Recognition-with-Tesseract
Here, we use **Tesseract**, an open source text recognition (OCR) Engine to identify any number that you have handwritten. All you need to do is easily install Tesseract and upload the image file name.

**Guidance on how to install Tesseract** is found at https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html

## How to use code
1. Find file path for **tesseract.exe** on your computer. The location of **tesseract.exe** is where you chose to install it during the installation process. If you weren't paying attention and didn't choose anything, *by default*, the Tesseract **folder** is installed in Program Files. Click on the folder and find a file simply named **tesseract** and copy the file path.
2. Replace "insert_filepath" in the code with your file path, *inside the quotation marks*.
3. Replace "image_file name here" with the name of your image.

## **Now you are done**.
